            offering
            various
            courses at undergraduate, postgraduate, doctoral and certificate level. Besides, it is a
            known
            fact
            that
            almost all the top global IT companies have a sizable number of Indian IT graduates working
            in
            various
            capacities. In fact, the USA accounts for more than 60% of Indian IT professionals.
        </p>
            <p> Information Technology courses are taught at both UG and PG degree level.
            Short-term
            courses
            like
            IT diploma and certifications are also offered by various institutions in India. Starting
            salary
            for
            an
            Information Technology graduate is INR 4 lakh per annum at junior level. At senior level,
            salary
            packages offered to freshers are above INR 7 lakh per annum.
        </p>
            <p> Many people often confuse IT with Computer Science Engineering (CSE). But the truth
            is,
            they
            are
            different, although they both include studying computers and computer systems.
